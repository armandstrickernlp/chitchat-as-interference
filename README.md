# Chitchat as Interference: Adding User Backstories to Task-Oriented Dialogues
During task-oriented dialogues (TODs), human users naturally introduce questions or information that is beyond the immediate scope of the task. This creates interferences which TOD systems cannot always handle. In this project, we create a testbed for building more resilient TOD systems. Using few-shot prmpting with an LLM, we create a novel chitchat augmentation for MultiWOZ in which a chatty user adds elements of backstory to their request, an interference to which the system responds with support and understanding while also advancing the task. We assess the resilience of 3 baselines, all based on SimpleToD.
