#### :pencil: &nbsp; Instructions

You will be presented with specific exchanges from various conversations, where a user interacts with a system to perform tasks such as **booking a train ticket, a restaurant, a taxi, a hotel, or looking for an attraction such as a museum**.  For each example, you will find **a situation** that explains why the user is interacting with the system, a single **exchange** between the user and the system and **previous turns** if the exchange is in the middle of the dialogue.  

**Your task** is to evaluate this single **exchange** along several criteria:

- **In the exchange, the user will introduce elements of backstory: assess whether the backstory can indeed be derived from their situation**   


- **For the system response, assess whether it provides support and understanding with respect to the user's backstory.**       

- **Overall, does the exchange sound natural and coherent?**
