#### :pencil: &nbsp; Instructions

- We will show you **50 dialogues** :speech_balloon: between a system and user, where a chatty user is trying to accomplish a task that may include booking a taxi, a restaurant, a train, getting information about a park, a museum etc...  
- You will be shown turns leading up to **3 possible system responses**.

- You will have to **rank these responses** based how well they help the user to **complete their booking** and how well they **naturally follow** the user's utterance.
- Select **1** for **the best** and **3** for **the worst**. **Try to be as decisive as possible!** 
- If you **cannot decide** which continuation is more appealing, you **can choose the same rank for several responses**.
- Note : You are going to assess **delexicalized** responses which means that they **contain placeholders**.
- Placeholders are descriptive. For example, [type], [name], [choice], [leaveat], and [leaveby] stand for the type of attraction, the actual name of a venue, number of available options, the time a train leaves and the time a train arrives by, respectively.
